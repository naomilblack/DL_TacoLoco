## Nice to Haves

Moving forward: 
1. Implement back-end server and add service and mocel files to be called from data source
2. Implment form validation to ensure all entries include required data.
3. Expand API model to include more unique data (address line 2, date ordered, customer number, etc)
3. Implement back end and front end check to ensure no duplicate data is entered.
4. Implement server side pagination and sorting
